# Military Spouse Coding Hackathon 2019

Every military family will have the dubious pleasure of participating in the very confusing and stressful experience of the dreaded **Permanent Change of Station**.

## How much will is this going to cost our family?

From rental trucks to weight management from travel days to perdiem. What is the actual cost of each PCS. What is DLA? JPPSO? Pocket PCS aims to answer these questions and provides military families with a budget tool to help them stay make the most out of their moves.

## How much will we get?

Whether you are doing your PCS as a partial Do It Yourself, or letting your service do it for you, there are **allowances** your family is authorized.

## Pocket PCS aims to make the process more transparent

**Pocket PCS** keeps track of what you've spent, compares it to what you're allowed and helps you and your family stay on budget.
